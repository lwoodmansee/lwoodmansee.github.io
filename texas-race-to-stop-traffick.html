                    <p class="question">What is Operation Underground Railroad?</p>
                    <p class="answer">Since 2013, Operation Underground Railroad (O.U.R.) has gathered the world’s experts in extraction operations and anti-child trafficking efforts to bring an end to child slavery. O.U.R. rescues victims and works with local resources in a comprehensive process involving justice for the perpetrators and recovery and rehabilitation for the survivors. To date, O.U.R. has rescued almost 700 victims and arrested some 300 human traffickers worldwide. Learn more at <a href="www.OURrescue.org">www.OURrescue.org.</a></p>
                    <p class="question">When is the race?</p>
                    <p class="answer">The event will be held on Saturday, October 21, 2017 at 7:30 a.m. at The Terrace in Westlake, Texas.</p>
                    <p class="question">What time should I be there on race day?</p>
                    <p class="answer">To ensure enough time for check in and packet pick up, 1-Mile participants should arrive between 7:30 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. and 5k race participants should arrive between 7:30 a.m. and 8:45 a.m. (unless packets have been picked up prior to the race). The 1-Mile Fun Run will begin at 8:15 a.m. and the 5k race will begin at 9:00 a.m. </p>
                    <p class="question">What do I get for participating?</p>
                    <p class="answer">All participants will receive a race t-shirt, complimentary race photos to download, tasty snacks to refuel, and the opportunity to participate in family-friendly festivities before and after the run. Children are also invited to our free Kids Zone during the 5k (must wear kids race bib to enter). Prizes will be awarded to the top three male and top three female 5k runners. Top finishing children from the 5k and 1-Mile Fun Run will also be awarded prizes.</p>
                     <p class="question">Are pets allowed?</p>
                    <p class="answer">Unfortunately we cannot accommodate pets at this event. Please do not bring them.</p>
                     <p class="question">I’d like to come but I can’t. What should I do?</p>
                    <p class="answer">For Modern Day “Abolitionists” who want to participate in the liberation efforts but who aren't local, you can participate virtually! As a virtual runner you will choose a 5k course on your own and run it in support of Operation Underground Railroad. You can choose to complete your Virtual Run on October 21st when the Race to Stop Traffick will be held, or choose a day that is convenient for you. Your race bib will be mailed to the address you provide upon registration. Optional t-shirts will be mailed after the race has taken place.</p>
                    <p class="answer">When you have completed your 5k Virtual Run, be sure to update your Facebook and Instagram status letting your friends and family know of your accomplishment! Add the hashtag: #racetostoptraffickdfw</p>
                     <p class="question">Can I volunteer at this event?</p>
                    <p class="answer">Yes, we need and welcome volunteers to assist in many areas! If you are interested in volunteering in planning or on race day, please contact us at racetostoptraffick.tx [at] gmail [dot] com.</p>
